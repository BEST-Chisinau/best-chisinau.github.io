Today we're doing a small step for organization and a big one for everyone who's our friend.
We're moving our website to GitHub.com.

What does that mean for us? Transparency and stability.

What does it mean for you? A place where you can always find information about us, help us fill and update content and sneak-peak some of our future events ;)

Happy blogging!
